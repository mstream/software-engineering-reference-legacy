## Properties {#properties}

Cryptoraphical hash functions, in addition to core features of 
[general hash functions](overview)

### Pre-image resistance {#pre-image-resistance}

Given hash digest $h$ it should be difficult to find a message 
$m$ that that $h = \operatorname{hash}(m)$

### Second pre-image resistance {#second-pre-image-resistance}

Given a message $m_1$ it should be difficult to find a different message
$m_2$ such that $\operatorname{hash}(m_1) = \operatorname{hash}(m_2)$

### Collision resistance {#collision-resistance}

It should be difficult to find pairs of $m_1$ and $m_2$ that 
$\operatorname{hash}(m_1) = \operatorname{hash}(m_2)$

## Examples of algorithms {#examples-of-algorithms}

* MD5
* SHA-1
* SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512)
* SHA-3
* Whirpool

## Passwords hashing {#passwords-hashing}

To protect users passwords from being exposed, it is desirable to store 
only their digests. The [pre-image resistance](#pre-image-resistance) makes it infeasible to 
restore their original values based on them. Despite the fact of 
not possesing the original password, the autentication is still possible
by asking the user to provide their password, applying the same hash
function to it, and comparing the result against the stored digest.
The [collision resistance](#collision-resistance) gives a reasurance that if digest
match it is virtually certain that the user presented the original 
password. Theoretically though, such an authentication process would be
successful for any password value resulting in the stored hash digest.

### Rainbow tables {#rainbow-tables}
Based on the fact that all cryptographic hash functions are
deterministic, it is possible to pre-compute results for a subset of 
inputs. For the brute-force type of attacks, usually the most probable
inputs are subject of that computation, such as words from encyclopedic
dictionaries or short sequences of characters. The existance of such
datbases, as well known as _rainbow tables_ makes short passwords almost
instantly identifiable for popular hashing algorithms, regardles of 
their strength.

### Password salting {#password-salting}
One of techniques which prevents from reusing pre-computed hash digests
is a technique called _password salting_. It requires storing a large, 
random serie of characters, a salt, along the hash digest. During the 
initial hash digest generation, the salt is appender or prepended to 
the original password before passing it to the hashing function.
Exactly the same process is followed during the password verification.
Even though the salt is non-secret, and therefore does not significantly
impede guessing the password or finding a collision, it prevents, to a
large extend, from re-using previously computed hash digests. That
increases cost of reverse-engineering passwords as each of them has to
be brute-forced individually.
