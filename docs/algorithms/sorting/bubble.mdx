Bubble sort is a very simple algorithm which repetedly iterates through
a list, swapping items in the desired order, until nothing is it is left
in the sorted state.

## Algorithm

```javascript title="bubble-sort.js"
for (let i = items.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    if (items[j] > items[j + 1]) {
      const tmp = items[j];
      items[j] = items[j + 1];
      items[j + 1] = tmp;
    }
  }
}
```
